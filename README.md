## Document Similarity Using Various Embedding Models

This repository contains code and models for document similarity analysis using different embeddings techniques, including Doc2Vec, Sentence-BERT, and Universal Sentence Encoder. It provides a comprehensive comparison of these methods for evaluating the semantic similarity between sentences and documents.

## Technologies Used

- **Gensim**: For training and using Doc2Vec models.
- **NLTK**: For tokenizing text.
- **Sentence-Transformers**: For using pre-trained Sentence-BERT models.
- **TensorFlow Hub**: For using the Universal Sentence Encoder.
- **Scipy**: For calculating cosine similarity.
- **Google Colab**: For executing the code in a cloud environment.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Before running the scripts, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install gensim nltk sentence-transformers tensorflow tensorflow-hub scipy matplotlib
```

## Full Code with Explanation

1. See the full code "Text_Similarity_Techniques.ipynb" for detailed explanation
   
## Running the Code

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shukdevtroy/Text-Similarity-Technique-using-NLP-code.git
    cd Text-Similarity-Technique-using-NLP-code
    ```

2. Run the Text_Similarity_Techniques.ipynb in Google Colab
